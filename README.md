# Dijkstra
 
This project is just made to understand and implement the algorithm of Dijkstra with c++ based in recursivity.
and this project consists of representing cities by an adjacent matrix, the user must fill in the matrix from which he types <1> if there is a path between two cities otherwise <0> if there is no path.
